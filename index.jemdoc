== Research Interests

My research interest is to develop correct-by-construction AI algorithms with advanced reasoning capabilities. My focus areas are:

- Reactive Synthesis
- Game and Hypergame Theory 
- Formal Logic: Temporal, Epistemic and Spatial Logic
- Applications: Cybersecurity, Robot Motion Planning 



== About me

I am a third year Ph.D. student in [https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering Robotics Engineering Program] at [https://www.wpi.edu Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)], advised by [https://users.wpi.edu/~jfu2/ Prof. Jie Fu]. I received my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from [http://www.vit.edu/ Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT)], Pune, India. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to worked on robot motion planning and cyber-physical systems that laid the foundation for my present research. I also started a student organization - Cognitive Robotics and Intelligent SysTems Lab (CRISTL) along with my colleague [https://monica-patel.com/ Monica Patel]. At CRISTL, we developed and fabricated an autonomous robot [curio.html Curio] to be used for teaching at VIT.
