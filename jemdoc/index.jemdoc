== About 

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [https://oden.utexas.edu/ Center for Autonomy] at the University of Texas at Austin, working with [https://autonomy.oden.utexas.edu/profiles/ufuk-topcu Prof. Ufuk Topcu]. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [https://ufl.edu University of Florida], Gainesville, in 2023, under the guidance of [https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/ Prof. Jie Fu]. 
Prior to that, I completed an M.S. in Robotics Engineering at [https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering Worcester Polytechnic Institute], Worcester, in 2021, also under the mentorship of [https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/ Prof. Jie Fu].

My research spans the interdisciplinary fields of computer science, control, and decision-making, with a strong emphasis on game theory, formal methods, motion planning, and multi-agent systems. Recently, my work has focused on advancing these foundations to address challenges in multi-agent systems and large-scale, LLM-driven games involving language-based negotiations.

I am deeply passionate about leveraging mathematical and computational rigor to tackle real-world problems, particularly in the domains of autonomy, robotics, and the security of cyber-physical systems.


== Research 

My currrent research employs *formal methods and logic* and *game-theory* to design *trustworthy and cognitively realistic autonomous systems* that enables them to exhibit human-like behaviors such as opportunism, deception, and preference-aware planning. 

My current projects include: 
    - *Game-theoretic Synthesis of Deceptive Strategies:* In a two-player adversarial interaction with asymmetric information, how can the player with superior information gain advantage over the opponent by employing deception? 

    - *Opportunistic Planning with Incomplete Preferences over Temporal Logic Objectives:* Given an incomplete (i.e., partial) preference over a set of linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas expressing temporal goals for an agent, how to synthesize a strategy that achieves the most preferred goal while reasoning about the uncertainties in the stochastic environment?

    - *Design of Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems under Sensor Attacks:* How to plan qualitatively (i.e., synthesize sure, almost-sure, positive winning strategies) in two-player partially observable stochastic games (POSG) in which the adversary can attack the observation function of the first player?

== News
- *\[Nov. 2023\]* I successfully defended my PhD thesis on "Sequential Decision Making in Games with Incomplete Information".
