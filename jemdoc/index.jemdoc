== Research Interests

I am presently exploring the use of /formal methods/ and /automated reasoning/ to synthesize strategies for autonomous agents capable of /deception/. 


My focus areas are:
- Reactive Synthesis
- Automated Reasoning
- Game and Hypergame Theory 
- Applications: Cybersecurity, Robot Motion Planning 


Please visit [publications.html my research and publications page] for detailed information about my ongoing research. 


== Bio

I am a fourth-year MS\/PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at [https://www.ufl.edu/ University of Florida] (UF). I transferred to UF from the Robotics Engineering department at [http://www.wpi.edu Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)]. I earned my B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from [http://www.vit.edu Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT)], Pune, India in 2016. At VIT, I founded the Cognitive Robotics and Intelligent Systems Lab (CRISTL), which was the first lab on campus to use an integrated cognitive science, machine learning and logic-based AI approach to design intelligent robots. While conducting research and teaching at CRISTL, I was intrigued by the question about /How to design an intelligent robot which can reason autonomously and, most importantly, in a provably-correct way?/ The quest to answer this question brought me to WPI, where under the guidance of [https://users.wpi.edu/~jfu2/ Prof. Jie Fu], I am exploring the formal methods approach (a logic-based AI approach) to allow autonomous agents to not only reason in a provably-correct way but also use advanced behaviors like deception to their advantage. At WPI, I am a member of [https://www.wpi.edu/academics/arts-sciences/resources/student-councils A&S Graduate Student Advisory Council] and also represent my department in the Graduate Student Government (GSG).
